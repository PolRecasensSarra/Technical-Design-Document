# Technical Design Document
I am Pol Recasens, student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in
Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s
subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).

# WHAT IS IT?

- Is a document made by a seasoned programmer, preferably the technical director or a lead programmer.

- Is part of the preproduction phase of a video game development.

- It specifies the technical resources that will be used.

- Set up the experimental features.

# WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?

- Reduces wasted efforts and confusion.

- It helps the team make their decisions.

- Make the reviewers optimistic about the game's chance of succeeding(the project is under control).

# WHAT DOES IT CONTAINS?

There are a lot of Technical Design Documents. Therefore, there's not one unique way to make it.
But, there are some sections that always appear.

- Introduction(Game summary and target platform)

- Technical goals(experimental features like unproven technologies and techniques or unique ideas)

- Technical risks(technologies with which the team has never worked)

- Development overview
    
- Estimated schedule

- Code style guidelines

- Code architecture

- Graphics(player screen)

- Audio(format)

## Introduction

- Include a game summary. Just a few lines.
- Target platform. It must be mentioned to which platform the game is directed.

## Technical goals

- It includes experimental features like unproven technologies and techniques or unique ideas.
- Don't include features that have been aleady proven by existing games, even if they are new to the development team.
- Experimental features generally need more time in the schedule.
- This experiments are seen as worthwhile investments to create a good renown in the future
